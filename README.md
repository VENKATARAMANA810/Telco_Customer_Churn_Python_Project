# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using supervised machine learning models. It aims to help businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their services and take proactive measures to retain them.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project uses a machine learning approach to classify whether a customer will churn based on demographics, services used, and account information.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset  
- **Format:** CSV (`telco.csv`)  
- **Target Column:** `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**  
   - Loaded the CSV dataset using Pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed missing values
   - Converted data types
   - Encoded categorical features

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution plots
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Churn rates by different customer attributes

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding
   - Feature scaling (if needed)

5. **Model Building**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest Classifier  
   - (Optional: Decision Tree, XGBoost, etc.)

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - ROC-AUC Curve

7. **Interpretation**  
   - Identified top features influencing churn  
   - Recommendations for churn reduction strategies
